# Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code (AoC) challenges in the years 2021 and 2023. Advent of Code is an annual event in December where each day a new algorithmic puzzle is released. This repository includes my personal solutions to these puzzles.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into two main directories, one for each year:

2021/
2023/
Each directory contains subdirectories for each day's puzzle, organized as follows:

```sh
- 2021/
  - day01/
    - main.py
    - input.txt
  - day02/
    - main.py
    - input.txt
  ...
- 2023/
  - day01/
    - puzzle.py
    - input.txt
    - README.md
  - day02/
    - puzzle.py
    - input.txt
    - README.md
  ...
```

Contents of Each Day's Directory
main.py: The Python script containing the solution for the day's puzzle.
input.txt: The input data provided for the puzzle.

## Solutions
In 2021, I managed to solve 16 out of the 24 puzzles.

In 2023, I managed to solve 15 out of the 24 puzzles.

## How to Run
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aoc-solutions.git
cd AoC
```

Navigate to the desired year's directory and the specific day's directory:

```sh
cd 2021/day01
```

Run the solution script:

```sh
python main.py
```
